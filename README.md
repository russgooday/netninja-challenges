# NetNinja Challenge 01

The challenge was set out on the basis of working in HTML, CSS and JS. I have done quite few menus over the years with that combination and was interested to see whether I could come up with an HTML, CSS only solution â€” I appreciate not ground-breaking :)

The burger button consists of a hidden checkbox and a 'label' tag wrapped around the burger. I then make use of a combination of the :checked pseudo and sibling selectors to flip between open and closed states.

In addition to clicking on the burger menu, I would expect the user to be able to close the menu by click any where outside of it. This is one drawback I see to my current CSS only solution.
